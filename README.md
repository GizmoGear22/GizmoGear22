- 👋 Hi, I’m @GizmoGear22
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, reading, minor gaming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding. Specifically javascript. C# and Python are on the to-do list. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing yet. I'll let you know when I find something worth collaborating on. For now, still learning the basics. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
